A characteristic of a ring is R is $n$ if the statement $ka = 0$ for all $a\in 2Z$ implies that $k$ is a multiple of $n$. Assume that $ka = 0$ for all $a\in 2Z$ for some $k$. In particular $2k = 0$. Hence $k=0$ and $n=0$. The answer is (A).,math,cot_lib-abstract_algebra

3,"A tank initially contains a salt solution of 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water. A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?","['3 + e^-2' '2 - e^-4' '2 - e^-2' '3 + e^-4' '2 + e^-3' '2 - e^-3'
 '3 - e^-2' '2 + e^-2' '2 + e^-4' '2']",I,8,"A: Let's think step by step. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, let $s(t)$ denote the number grams of salt in the tank at the $t$ minute mark. Then $s(0) = 3$.
We use $s$ and $s(t)$ interchangeably. We also use $s^{\prime}$ and $s^{\prime}(t)$ interchangeably. The solution sprayed into the tank adds $(0.02) 4=2 / 25$ grams of salt per minute. There are always 100 liters of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ grams of salt. So the density of salt in the tank is $s / 100$ grams per liter. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $4(s / 100)=s / 25$ grams of salt per minute. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $s^{\prime}(t)=(2 / 25)-(s / 25)=(2-s) / 25$, and so $[s(t)=2] \Rightarrow\left[s^{\prime}(t)=0ight]$. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$,
$$
rac{d}{d t}[\ln (s-2)]=rac{s^{\prime}}{s-2}=rac{-1}{25}=rac{d}{d t}\left[-rac{t}{25}ight] .
$$
Choose $C \in \mathbb{R}$ such that, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}, \ln ((s(t)-2))=-[t / 25]+C$. Let $K:=e^{C}$. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $(s(t))-2=K e^{-t / 25}$, and so $s(t)=2+K e^{-t / 25}$. Then $3=s(0)=2+K e^{0}=2+K$, so $K=1$. Then $s(100)=2+K e^{-100 / 25}=2+1 \cdot e^{-4}=2+e^{-4}$.

The most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.
The circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.
I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.
I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.
I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.
All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.
