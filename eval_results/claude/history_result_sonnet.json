The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,\u201d 2003\nMaize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico is most analogous to which of the following?", "options": "[\"Buffalo hunting among the Lakota Sioux\",\"Whaling by the Makah\",\"Seal hunting among the Inuit\",\"Salmon fishing among the Chinook\",\"Cattle herding by the Apache\",\"Wolf domestication by the Algonquians\",\"Mixed agriculture among the Iroquois\",\"Deer hunting by the Seminole\"]", "answer": "G", "answer_index": 6, "cot_content": "Let's think step by step.", "category": "history", "src": "ori_mmlu-high_school_us_history", "pred": "G", "response": "Based on the information provided, the answer is G.
