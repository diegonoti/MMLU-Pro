We will not say we are going to try to guarantee any equality \u2026 but we do say that one third of the average is low enough for any one family to hold, that there should be a guarantee of a family wealth of around $5,000; enough for a home, an automobile, a radio, and the ordinary conveniences, and the opportunity to educate their children.\u2026\nWe will have to limit fortunes.

Roosevelt's initial New Deal programs had been implemented from 1933-1934, but he faced criticism from both the left and right that these weren't enough.\n\n4. In response to this criticism and challenges from figures like Huey Long, Roosevelt launched what became known as the \"Second New Deal\" in 1935.\n\n5. The Second New Deal included several major pieces of legislation, including the Social Security Act, which established a system of old-age pensions and unemployment insurance.\n\n6. This move was seen as a way to address some of the concerns raised by populist figures like Long without going as far as their more radical proposals.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is:\n\nThe answer is C.

Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated for whom the actions have been brought are, by reason of the segregation complained of, deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\nBrown v.

The Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954 dealt with racial segregation in schools.\n\n2. The question asks about \"unfulfilled promises\" that this decision was responding to.\n\n3. We need to look for an earlier initiative that promised equality or rights for African Americans but didn't fully deliver.\n\n4. Looking at the options:\n   - The New Deal, Fair Deal, New Frontier, Square Deal, Great Society, and War on Poverty are all 20th century initiatives, after or close to the time of Brown v. Board.\n   - The Progressive Era was mainly focused on economic and political reforms.\n   - The Civil Rights Act came after Brown v. Board.\n   - The Emancipation Proclamation was specifically about freeing slaves, not about education.\n\n5. This leaves us with Reconstruction, which occurred right after the Civil War in the late 1860s and 1870s.\n\n6. Reconstruction promised political and social equality for freed slaves, including access to education. However, these promises were largely unfulfilled as Jim Crow laws and segregation took hold in the South.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Reconstruction. The Brown v. Board of Education decision was, in part, addressing the unfulfilled promises of equality and integrated education that were made during Reconstruction.\n\nThe answer is D."}, {"question_id": 5015, "question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Wherever I go\u2014the street, the shop, the house, or the steamboat\u2014I hear the people talk in such a way as to indicate that they are yet unable to conceive of the Negro as possessing any rights at all. Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'\n\"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate.\"\n\u2014Congressional testimony of Col.

The question asks about Alexander Hamilton's views in Federalist #15.\n\n2. However, the given excerpt is not from Federalist #15. It's a testimony about the treatment of freed slaves after the Civil War.\n\n3. The options provided don't seem to directly relate to the excerpt, but rather to Hamilton's concerns about the weaknesses of the government under the Articles of Confederation.\n\n4. Among the options, the one that most closely aligns with Hamilton's known views in Federalist #15 is:\n\n   H. a weak central government without the powers to address pressing issues.\n\n5. Hamilton was a strong advocate for a more powerful central government, arguing that the weak confederation was unable to effectively govern or solve national problems.\n\nTherefore, based on our knowledge of Hamilton's arguments in the Federalist Papers, and despite the disconnect between the question and the provided excerpt, the answer is most likely:\n\nThe answer is H. a weak central government without the powers to address pressing issues."}]
