They were replaced by \"intrusive\" curacas (criollos, peninsulares, and mestizos) who didn't understand Andean reciprocity and redistribution.\n\n3. As a result, the varayocs (indigenous mayors) gained more importance.\n\n4. However, unlike the indigenous nobility, varayocs were elected annually from among common indigenous people.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\nI. Indigenous ethnic leadership weakened, despite the strengthening of the varayoc figure.\n   This seems true, as the traditional curacas were replaced and varayocs had less power.\n\nII. The intrusive curacas contributed to politically weakening indigenous communities.\n   This also seems true, as they didn't understand traditional Andean practices.\n\nIII. The varayocs strengthened ethnic leadership, despite the presence of intrusive curacas.\n   This seems false. While varayocs gained importance, they were elected annually and didn't have the same power as traditional curacas.\n\nIV. The varayocs sought to replace the blood curacas, without managing to compensate for their prestige and power.\n   This seems true. Varayocs gained importance but couldn't fully replace the traditional curacas' influence.\n\nBased on this analysis, statements I, II, and IV appear to be correct.\n\nThe answer is (H) I, II y IV."}]
