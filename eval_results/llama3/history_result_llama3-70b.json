To which in the state of nature there are many things wanting.

For though the law of nature be plain and intelligible to all rational creatures; yet men, being biased by their interest, as well as ignorant for want of studying it, are not apt to allow of it as a law binding to them in the application of it to their particular cases. Secondly, in the state of nature there wants a known and indifferent judge, with authority to determine all differences according to the established law. For every one in that state being both judge and executioner of the law of nature, men being partial to themselves, passion and revenge is very apt to carry them too far in punishing others, and not enough in punishing themselves. Thirdly, when men are once got together, and have submitted themselves to the will of the majority, there wants a power to back and support the sentence they give, and to give it due execution. They that have supreme power, especially in the state of nature, are not apt to part with it, or to come under the restraint of laws, which may abate their power, and curb their wills. They that are under their power, are not apt to submit to their decrees, but rather to rebel against them.

According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,\u201d 2003\nMaize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico is most analogous to which of the following?", "options": "[\"Buffalo hunting among the Lakota Sioux\",\"Whaling by the Makah\",\"Seal hunting among the Inuit\",\"Salmon fishing among the Chinook\",\"Cattle herding by the Apache\",\"Wolf domestication by the Algonquians\",\"Mixed agriculture among the Iroquois\",\"Deer hunting by the Seminole\"]", "answer": "G", "answer_index": 6, "cot_content": "Let think step by step.", "category": "history", "src": "ori_mmlu-high_school_us_history", "pred": "G", "response": " Let's think step by step.

Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked 'insufficient funds.' But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.\"\n\u2014"}, {"question_id": 4744, "question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The seeds of totalitarian regimes are nurtured by misery and want.

Jefferson was very tall, six feet two-and-a-half inches in height; sandy-complexioned; shy in manner, seeming cold; awkward in attitude, and with little in his bearing that suggested command.\u2026 His skin was thin, peeling from his face on exposure to the sun, giving it a tettered appearance. This sandy face, with hazel eyes and sunny aspect; this loose, shackling person; this rambling and often brilliant conversation, belonged to the controlling influences of American history, more necessary to the story than three-fourths of the official papers, which only hid the truth. Jefferson's personality during these eight years appeared to be the government, and impressed itself, like that of Bonaparte, although by a different process, on the mind of the nation. In the village simplicity of Washington, he was more than a king, for he was alone in social as well as in political pre-eminence. Except the British Legation, no house in Washington was open to general society; the whole mass of politicians, even the Federalists, were dependent on Jefferson and \"The Palace\" for amusement; and if they refused to go there, they \"lived like bears, brutalized and stupefied.\"\n\u2014Henry Adams, History of the United States During the Administration of Thomas Jefferson, 1889\nAs the great-grandson of President John Adams, the historian Henry Adams might have been expected to be which of the following?", "options": "[\"Focused on the social aspect of Jefferson's reign\",\"More interested in the political landscape of Washington\",\"Supportive of the policies of John Adams\",\"Critical of the policies of Thomas Jefferson\",\"Indifferent to the actions of Thomas Jefferson\",\"Supportive of the policies of Thomas Jefferson\",\"Supportive of the British Legation\",\"More interested in the French and Indian War\",\"Critical of the Constitutional Convention\",\"Biased towards the Federalists\"]", "answer": "D", "answer_index": 3, "cot_content": "Let think step by step.", "category": "history", "src": "ori_mmlu-high_school_us_history", "pred": "D", "response": " Let's think step by step.

The one prays, the other trembles. The one is never satisfied, the other is never secure. This spectacle is not peculiar to the United States; it is to be seen in all the countries of the world, but it is more striking in America than elsewhere. In Europe, the poor are not so poor, the rich are not so rich, and the distance between them is not so great. In America, the lowest class is more destitute, the highest class is more opulent, and the distance between them is greater. In America, the struggle between the classes is more bitter, more intense, more implacable. The Americans are not, as is often said, a happy people. They are a people who are always striving, always struggling, always pushing forward. They are a people who are never satisfied with what they have, who are always seeking something better.

The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.\"\n\u2014John C.

Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. In a sense we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked 'insufficient funds.' But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so we have come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.\"\nWho is the speaker of this excerpt"}, {"question_id": 5019, "question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The power . . . given to the commanding officer over all the people of each district is that of an absolute monarch.
