The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,\u201d 2003\nMaize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico is most analogous to which of the following?", "options": "[\"Buffalo hunting among the Lakota Sioux\",\"Whaling by the Makah\",\"Seal hunting among the Inuit\",\"Salmon fishing among the Chinook\",\"Cattle herding by the Apache\",\"Wolf domestication by the Algonquians\",\"Mixed agriculture among the Iroquois\",\"Deer hunting by the Seminole\"]", "answer": "G", "answer_index": 6, "cot_content": "Let's think step by step.", "category": "history", "src": "ori_mmlu-high_school_us_history", "pred": "G", "response": "The answer is (G) Mixed agriculture among the Iroquois.\n\nThe passage discusses the development of a Latin American form of rights discourse, which was influenced by Thomistic moral philosophy and the ideas of Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, who argued for the natural rights and common humanity of the indigenous peoples of the New World. \n\nIn this context, the cultivation of maize by the native peoples of Mexico is most analogous to the mixed agriculture practiced by the Iroquois, which involved the cultivation of crops like maize, beans, and squash alongside hunting and gathering activities.

It is a place where man can renew contact with nature. It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race. It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods.

An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n\u2014Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766\nThe policy described most immediately led to", "options": "[\"the American Revolution.\",\"a negotiated settlement between the tribes of the Southeast and the U.S. government, by which the tribes were allowed to remain on their lands for ten years.\",\"the forced removal of the Cherokee from their homeland.\",\"the first Treaty of Fort Laramie, which guaranteed Indian possession of lands west of the Mississippi River.\",\"peace between Indian tribes and white settlers.\",\"the introduction of the Stamp Act.\",\"the Treaty of Paris, ending the Revolutionary War.\",\"the start of the French and Indian War.\",\"the creation of the United States Constitution.\",\"the formation of the United States Congress.\"]", "answer": "C", "answer_index": 2, "cot_content": "Let's think step by step.", "category": "history", "src": "ori_mmlu-high_school_us_history", "pred": "A", "response": "Based on the information provided in the passage, the policy described most immediately led to the American Revolution.

Participants in the Seneca Falls Convention would be most likely to support the perspective of the Married Women's Property Act.\n\nThe Married Women's Property Act of 1848 in New York State granted married women the right to own property, which was a key demand of the women's rights movement. The Seneca Falls Convention in 1848 was a pivotal event in the early women's rights movement, where the Declaration of Sentiments was issued, calling for equal rights and opportunities for women, including property rights for married women. Therefore, the participants in the Seneca Falls Convention would be the group most likely to support the perspective embodied in the Married Women's Property Act."}, {"question_id": 5048, "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nOur leaders talk about stopping aggression from the north, but this was a struggle among groups of Vietnamese until we intervened. We seem bent upon saving the Vietnamese from Ho Chi Minh even if we have to kill them and demolish their country to do it. As the native people survey bombed-out villages, women and children burned by napalm, rice crops destroyed and cities overrun with our military personnel, they are doubtless saying secretly of the Vietcong guerillas and of the American forces, \"A plague on both your houses.\" \u2026 Stop the bombing, north and south, end search and destroy offensive sweeps, and confine our military action to holding operations on the ground. Bombing the north has failed to halt or seriously check the flow of troops to the south and may, in fact, have prompted a much greater war effort by Hanoi.\n\u2014Senator George McGovern, \"The Lessons of Vietnam,\" April 25, 1967\nPolitical discord during the Vietnam War most closely resembled the political dissensions during which of the following?", "options": "[\"The American Revolutionary War\",\"World War I\",\"The War of 1812\",\"The American Civil War\",\"The Cold War\",\"The Korean War\",\"World War II\",\"The Spanish-American War\",\"The Mexican War\",\"The Persian Gulf War\"]", "answer": "I", "answer_index": 8, "cot_content": "Let's think step by step.", "category": "history", "src": "ori_mmlu-high_school_us_history", "pred": "D", "response": "The political discord during the Vietnam War most closely resembled the political dissensions during the American Civil War.\n\nThe passage highlights the divided opinions and perspectives within the United States regarding the Vietnam War, with Senator George McGovern criticizing the US government's military intervention and actions in Vietnam. This mirrors the deep political divisions and discord that existed within the United States during the American Civil War, where there were stark differences between the Union and Confederate sides.\n\nThe passage does not indicate similarities to the political climate during other wars listed, such as the American Revolutionary War, World War I, the War of 1812, the Cold War, the Korean War, World War II, the Spanish-American War, the Mexican War, or the Persian Gulf War.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) The American Civil War."}]
